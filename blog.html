      <p>Hi Everyone! It is already getting close to Haloween Season. It is crazy how fast the time flies by. I know the new moms out there know exactly what I am talking about. I have posted the new Haloween Collection to my site. I have been getting so many requests for matching attire for parents and children. I hear you all and I am working on coming up with some classic designs for all of you. </p>
        <p>I am also starting a new hobby where I am getting into canned goods. So far I have made applie pie filling, strawberry, rasberry, and peach jam. I want to hear from you guys if you would be interested in purchasing some of the canned goods. I am still experimenting with flavors and also going to try and incorporate the best way to make sugar free fillings. I will keep you all updated on my progress. Also, feel free to send me some of your favorite flavors and I will try by best to to get it done for you all.</p>
         <p>Thank you all once again for supporting my small business. It means the world to me. Please post and share on social media and tag me with the items you recieve!!</p>
